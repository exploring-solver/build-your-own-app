# Live Location Tracker App

## Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept mobile application that demonstrates real-time location tracking using React Native with Expo, React Navigation, and a Node.js backend with Socket.IO for real-time communication. The app showcases how to implement live location sharing and tracking between users.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: React Native, Expo, React Navigation
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO
- Maps: React Native Maps
- Location Services: Expo Location

### How It Works

The app allows users to share their location in real-time and track other users' locations. It uses Expo's location services to get the device's location and Socket.IO to transmit this data to the server and other connected clients.

### Potential Industry Applications

- Logistics: Fleet tracking and management
- Ride-sharing: Driver and passenger location tracking
- Safety: Family member location sharing
- Field Services: Technician location tracking
- Event Management: Attendee and staff coordination

### Adding Navigators and Screens

1. Create a `StackNavigator.js` in the `src/navigation/` directory.
2. Create screen components (e.g., `HomeScreen.js`, `ShareLocationScreen.js`, `TrackUserScreen.js`) in the `src/screens/` directory.
3. Set up the stack navigator in `App.js`.

### Best Practices for Scalability and Performance

1. Optimize location updates to balance accuracy and battery life.
2. Implement efficient state management (e.g., Context API or Redux).
3. Use memoization for expensive computations.
4. Implement proper error handling and logging.
5. Use background services for continuous location tracking when the app is not in the foreground.

## Libraries Used

- React Navigation: Routing and navigation
- React Native Maps: Displaying maps and markers
- Expo Location: Accessing device location
- Socket.IO Client: Real-time communication with the server

## How the Code Works

### Frontend

1. The app starts with `App.js`, which sets up the navigation structure.
2. `HomeScreen.js` displays a map with the user's current location.
3. `ShareLocationScreen.js` allows users to start/stop sharing their location.
4. `TrackUserScreen.js` enables users to track another user's location in real-time.
5. `LocationService.js` handles location updates and communication with the server.

### Backend

1. `server.js` sets up the Express server and Socket.IO connection.
2. `socketHandler.js` manages real-time location updates and user tracking.
3. `User.js` model stores user information in MongoDB.


## Screen-Specific Code Explanation

### HomeScreen.js

The HomeScreen displays the user's current location on a map:

1. State and Hook Setup:
   ```jsx
   const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);
   const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState(null);
   ```
   - Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the location state and potential error messages.

2. Location Permission and Fetching:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     (async () => {
       let { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
       if (status !== 'granted') {
         setErrorMsg('Permission to access location was denied');
         return;
       }

       let location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
       setLocation(location);
     })();
   }, []);
   ```
   - Uses `useEffect` hook to request location permissions and fetch the current location when the component mounts.
   - Updates the location state or sets an error message.

3. Rendering the Map:
   ```jsx
   return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
       {location ? (
         <MapView
           style={styles.map}
           initialRegion={{
             latitude: location.coords.latitude,
             longitude: location.coords.longitude,
             latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
             longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
           }}
         >
           <Marker
             coordinate={{
               latitude: location.coords.latitude,
               longitude: location.coords.longitude,
             }}
             title="Your Location"
           />
         </MapView>
       ) : (
         <Text>{errorMsg || 'Loading...'}</Text>
       )}
     </View>
   );
   ```
   - Renders a MapView component when location is available.
   - Displays a marker at the user's current location.
   - Shows a loading message or error if the location is not yet available.

### ShareLocationScreen.js

This screen allows users to start and stop sharing their location:

1. State and Socket Setup:
   ```jsx
   const [isSharing, setIsSharing] = useState(false);
   const socket = useRef(null);
   ```
   - Manages the sharing state and keeps a reference to the socket connection.

2. Location Sharing Logic:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isSharing) {
       socket.current = io('YOUR_BACKEND_URL');
       startLocationUpdates();
     } else {
       if (socket.current) {
         socket.current.disconnect();
       }
       stopLocationUpdates();
     }

     return () => {
       if (socket.current) {
         socket.current.disconnect();
       }
     };
   }, [isSharing]);
   ```
   - Establishes or disconnects the socket connection based on the sharing state.
   - Starts or stops location updates accordingly.

3. Location Update Function:
   ```jsx
   const startLocationUpdates = async () => {
     const { status } = await Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync();
     if (status !== 'granted') {
       setErrorMsg('Permission to access location was denied');
       return;
     }

     await Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync('LOCATION_TASK', {
       accuracy: Location.Accuracy.Balanced,
       timeInterval: 5000,
       distanceInterval: 10,
     });
   };
   ```
   - Requests background location permissions.
   - Starts location updates using Expo's `Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync`.

4. Background Location Task:
   ```jsx
   TaskManager.defineTask('LOCATION_TASK', ({ data, error }) => {
     if (error) {
       console.error(error);
       return;
     }
     if (data) {
       const { locations } = data;
       socket.current.emit('updateLocation', {
         userId: 'USER_ID', // Replace with actual user ID
         latitude: locations[0].coords.latitude,
         longitude: locations[0].coords.longitude,
       });
     }
   });
   ```
   - Defines a background task to handle location updates.
   - Emits the new location to the server via the socket connection.

### TrackUserScreen.js

This screen allows tracking another user's location:

1. State Setup:
   ```jsx
   const [userId, setUserId] = useState('');
   const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState(null);
   const socket = useRef(null);
   ```
   - Manages the tracked user's ID and location, and keeps a socket reference.

2. Socket Connection and Listening:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     socket.current = io('YOUR_BACKEND_URL');
     
     socket.current.on('locationUpdate', (data) => {
       if (data.userId === userId) {
         setUserLocation({
           latitude: data.latitude,
           longitude: data.longitude,
         });
       }
     });

     return () => {
       if (socket.current) {
         socket.current.disconnect();
       }
     };
   }, [userId]);
   ```
   - Establishes a socket connection when the component mounts.
   - Listens for location updates and updates the state when the tracked user's location changes.

3. Start Tracking Function:
   ```jsx
   const startTracking = () => {
     socket.current.emit('startTracking', { userId });
   };
   ```
   - Emits a 'startTracking' event to the server with the user ID to track.

4. Rendering the Tracked Location:
   ```jsx
   return (
     <View style={styles.container}>
       <TextInput
         value={userId}
         onChangeText={setUserId}
         placeholder="Enter User ID to track"
       />
       <Button title="Start Tracking" onPress={startTracking} />
       {userLocation && (
         <MapView
           style={styles.map}
           region={{
             ...userLocation,
             latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
             longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
           }}
         >
           <Marker coordinate={userLocation} title="Tracked User" />
         </MapView>
       )}
     </View>
   );
   ```
   - Provides an input for the user ID to track.
   - Displays a map with the tracked user's location when available.

These code explanations demonstrate key concepts in React Native and Expo app development for location-based applications, including:

- Requesting and handling location permissions
- Using Expo's Location API for getting and tracking location
- Implementing real-time communication with Socket.IO
- Rendering maps and markers with React Native Maps
- Managing component state and side effects with React hooks
- Handling background tasks for continuous location updates

By understanding these patterns and techniques, developers can create robust location-based applications with real-time tracking capabilities.
